# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python and libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. The goal is to understand the data, identify missing values, detect outliers, and explore relationships between different features and survival.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the classic Titanic dataset from Kaggle:  
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data

## 📊 Steps Performed

- Data Loading and Overview
- Handling Missing Values
- Univariate Analysis (Age, Fare, Sex, etc.)
- Bivariate Analysis (Survival vs other features)
- Outlier Detection
- Correlation Heatmap
- Feature Encoding (Sex, Embarked)

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 📁 Files Included

- `titanic_eda.ipynb` – The full EDA notebook

## ✅ Next Steps

- Feature engineering
- Model building (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
